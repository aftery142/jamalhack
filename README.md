The Game

osu mod

shitty by design
### usage
drag your osu exe into the patcher exe

tested on bancho ainu n ripple
### incomprehensive list of features
- extra skinnables (songselect-bottom, menu-copyright, etc...)

- rate changer (timewarp) should work on circleguard

- discord presence

- submission dialog

- some streamproof shit

- no flashlight (streamproof)

- no spectators

- hwid changer

- taikomania fix

- some misc shit nobody cares about
### binds
page up = uprate 0.05

page down = downrate 0.05

home = reload config

end = idk something happens

enter = confirm submission

backspace = cancel submission
### in case it breaks
idk i might update but otherwise nuke this shit and dont look back, get the one k00l paid software thing idc lol

but then again why bother with ***online rankings*** in a *rhythm game*

more importantly why not try a better rhythm game
